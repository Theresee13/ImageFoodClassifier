# Food Image Classification

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying food images into three categories: **Meals, Drinks, and Desserts**. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and OpenCV for data preprocessing and training.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images organized into three categories: Meals, Drinks, and Desserts. The images were preprocessed to remove any corrupted or unsupported formats before training.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned to remove invalid images and ensure compatibility for training.
2. **Model Training:** A deep learning model was trained using TensorFlow to classify images into the three categories.
3. **Evaluation:** The model's performance was assessed, and improvements were considered for better accuracy.
4. **Inference:** The trained model was used to classify new images into one of the three categories.

## Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in distinguishing between meals, drinks, and desserts. Further improvements can be made by enhancing the dataset and refining the model.
